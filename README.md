## Plugin Overview

- **Name:** ChestSortPlugin
- **Version:** 1.2
- **Description:**  
    ChestSortPlugin is a lightweight Minecraft plugin for **Paper 1.21.4** servers that automatically sorts items in chests and player inventories using multiple configurable methods. It sorts items based on a configurable category order (e.g., Weapons, Tools, Armor, Others, Blocks) while preserving item metadata, enchantments, and other properties. The plugin ensures that hotbar items and worn armor remain unaffected.

## Features

1. **Shift+Click Sorting**
    - **Function:** Automatically sorts the chest or player inventory when a player shift-clicks on an empty slot.
    - **Sorting Priority:**  
        The order is configurable in the `config.yml` under `sorting_order`. By default, it might be:
        1. **WEAPONS** (Swords, Bows, Crossbows, Tridents)
        2. **TOOLS** (Pickaxes, Axes, Shovels, Hoes, Shears)
        3. **ARMOR** (Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, Boots, Shields)
        4. **OTHERS** (Miscellaneous items)
        5. **BLOCKS** (Sorted alphabetically)
        - Does **not** modify hotbar items.
        - Respects stack limits (max 64 items per stack).
        - Does **not** alter worn armor.
          
2. **Auto Chest Sorting**
    - **Function:** When enabled, automatically sorts the contents of chests (or other containers) upon closing.
      
3. **Additional Hotkeys**
    - **Function:** Provides hotkey actions for transferring items between a chest and the playerâ€™s inventory:
        - **Left-Click Outside:** Transfers matching items (except hotbar) **to chest**.
        - **Right-Click Outside:** Transfers matching items **from chest** to inventory.
        - **Double-Left-Click Outside:** Transfers **all items** (except hotbar) **to chest**.
        - **Double-Right-Click Outside:** Transfers **all items** **from chest** into inventory.
    - **Note:** These actions are enabled or disabled via the in-game settings GUI.
      
4. **Unified Settings GUI**
    - **Function:** Use the `/chestsort` command (with no arguments) to open settings GUI where players can toggle features on or off.
      
5. **Configurable Options**
    - **Sorting Order:**  
        Define the category order for sorting in the `config.yml` under `sorting_order`.
    - **Messages:**  
        All in-game messages (e.g., sort completion, transfer notifications, usage reminders) are configurable and can be disabled entirely.
    - **Double-Click Delay:**  
        The delay for detecting double-clicks for hotkey functions is configurable.
    - **Sound Settings:**  
        Configure the sorting sound and the GUI toggle sound.
